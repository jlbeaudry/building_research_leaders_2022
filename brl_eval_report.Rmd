Hugh Kearns from ThinkWell designed and delivered the 
*Building Research Leaders for Early Career Researchers* workshop. The series of 
six sessions that comprise this program are being run from April to November 2022. 
At the time of the survey, Hugh had offered five of the six sessions. 
Of the `r participants` participants in the workshop, `r nrow(df)` completed this evaluation.

On average, the respondents to this survey attended `r round(mean(df$attendance),2)` 
of the 5 sessions, ranging from `r min(df$attendance)` to `r max(df$attendance)`.
Their explanations for why they attended the sessions that they did are shown in 
`r table_nums("attendance", display = "cite")` in the Appendix. 

We asked participants to rate a number of items about the workshop and the trainer 
on a scale from 'strongly disagree' to 'strongly agree' (see 
`r fig_nums(name = "ratings_summary", display = "cite")`).

\
`r fig_nums(name = "ratings_summary")`

We had a mix of participants in this workshop (nominated by their Deans of Research). 
The respondents to the survey reflected this mix; `r years[1,2]` respondent
was `r years [1,1]` post-PhD, `r years[2,2]` respondents were `r years [2,1]` post-PhD,
and `r years[3,2]` respondents were `r years [3,1]` post-PhD. 

All respondents indicated that the program partly or fully met or exceeded their expectations. 
Of the `r nrow(df)` respondents, `r round((expect[1,2]/nrow(df))*100,2)`% indicated 
that it met or exceeded their expectations. 

`r table_nums("info_workshop", display = "cite")` reports what the respondents
said they expected from the workshop. Their explanations of how the program aligned with their expectations are shown 
in `r table_nums("expectations", display = "cite")`.
